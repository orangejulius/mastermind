Starting point of some optimizations.

using -ggdb -O2 in a 4 peg, 6 color game:

81.5B instructions
41B in memmove (called 844M times)
26B in vector= (called 838M times)
2B in State=   (called 837M times)
1.3B in State::score (called 2.6M times)
305M in free (called 9.4M times)
233M in Environment::getGameByNumber (called 1.6M times)

15M in Environment::getNumGames (called 1.6M times)
5M in Environment::getNumPegs (called 2.6M times)
5M in Environment::getNumColors (called 2.6M times)
